# Welcome to My About Me
Thank you for visiting my profile; it means a lot to me. Here, I will share some information about myself as a person and as a developer.

## About Me
I'm a 17-year-old Python developer from Ukraine. I have been learning Python for almost 3 years and am also working on learning C++. 

## About Me as a Programmer
I am proficient in the basics of Python and C++. Currently, I am enhancing my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). I'm moving towards backend development and am currently learning FastAPI. I am also working on the backend of a large website, which involves:
- Refactoring a GitHub script (Amazon Flex offers parser); I have rewritten more than half of it.
- Developing a bot that handles commands from Telegram and interacts with the website using web sockets.
- Implementing numerous async functions.

I have already created more than 10 Telegram bots, ranging from simple to complex. I have successfully sold 2 of them, both of which work perfectly.
